# Cube Textured

This example demonstrates how to render a textured cube.

## Features

- Renders a 3D cube with a dynamically generated texture mapped onto its surfaces
  - Generates a dynamic texture using the Mandelbrot fractal algorithm
- Uses vertex buffer with position and texture coordinate data for each vertex
- Implements a complete 3D rendering pipeline with depth testing

## Running

To build and run this example:

```shell
build.bat|sh 06_cube_textured run
```
